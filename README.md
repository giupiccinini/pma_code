With this basic code it is possible to calculate the Proper Motion Anomaly (PMA) and to derive the masses of long period objects, taking advantage of the variations in a star’s measured
proper motion over time due to orbital acceleration.

**A more detailed README will be soon provide.**

The code uses the observational epochs from “The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues” (ESA 1997) and the “Gaia Observation Forecast Tool” (GOST) and averaged them over their respective observational windows.
The Hipparcos time series and the Gaia observational epochs files can be in the .dat or .txt format.

The Radial Velocity file is composed with three columns: time, RV data, RV errors.
